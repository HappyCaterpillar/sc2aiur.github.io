## Welcome to the r/AllThingsProtoss content aggregator website!

Head on over to [our list of current content](/posts/) to skip the rationale
and start learning Protoss :)

The website arose out of a perceived lack of a common knowledge base for Protoss players.
Terrans have [TerranCraft](https://terrancraft.com/) and Zergs have
[sc2swarm.com](sc2swarm.com); it was *hell, about time* for us alien bois to
get a place of our own besides the [ATP
sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/), maintained since 2012 by heroic moderators.

The website is obviously mostly a work in progress; the whole idea is that we
get together and work on this collaboratively: everyone with a [GitHub (free)
account](https://github.com/) can submit guides, videos, notes, as small
Markdown snippets, [with a template and tutorial note
here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sc2aiur/sc2aiur.github.io/src/CONTENT_TEMPLATE.md).
Maintainers (*for the time being, that's me!*) filter out troll entries and
merge the content if it's trustworthy and noncontroversial. Controversial stuff
can and should be discussed on Reddit or Discord before merging.

Ideally, this will become something we can link to Protoss newbies and say,
*yeah, it's good stuff, we've vetted it and it makes sense - follow these and
you'll get diamond in no time*.

This means we're currently in need of three distinct categories of help:

1. Content! For starters, I've added a few guides I've recently used and some
   stuff from the ATP sidebar. However, every time you come across something
   worth recommending, submit it here!
2. Maintainers! This would mean joining the [GitHub SC2Aiur
   org](https://github.com/sc2aiur) and taking some time to
   occasionally review submitted content. Reach out on Discord if you're interested.
3. Website suggestions! It's obviously a very early prototype and I'm still tinkering with it.
   Please report any issues or suggestions you may have on
   [GitHub](https://github.com/sc2aiur/sc2aiur.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc),
   Discord or Reddit. I'm sure there's a lot of bugs to be fixed; pointing them out is the fastest way to get that done.
    * a sidebar is on its way once I figure out how to set it up.
    * help with fixing these issues, as with all open source, is obviously most welcome!

Signed,
